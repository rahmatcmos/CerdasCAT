This repository will held my work on CerdasCAT.
To use this, you must use Netbeans. and do the following :
#1. Use the latest Ant
#2. Copy catalina-ant.jar from Apache Tomcat Lib folder into netbeans ant lib 
    folder, in [NETBEAN HOME]\java\ant\lib
#3. Open build.properties, change :
    tomcat.home= [tomcat path]
    tomcat.username=[admin name]
    tomcat.password=[admin password]
    tomcat.url=http://localhost:[Tomcat Port]
#4. Open application.config.Config.java and inspect the properties there, and change accordingly
#5. Open applicaiton.controllers.Database.java and change the database configuration accordingly.

That's all and you'll be going fast! :)
